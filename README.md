## Overview

Welcome to the **Self-Driving Car Race Simulation**! This project demonstrates a fully interactive race between a user-controlled car and an AI-driven car. The AI has been trained using a custom neural network, allowing it to navigate and race on a simulated road, avoiding traffic and obstacles.

## Features

### 🏎️ Car Driving Mechanics
Experience realistic car driving mechanics designed for an engaging racing experience.

### 🛣️ Road Definition
The simulation features a well-defined road system, providing a structured environment for the race.

### 📡 Artificial Sensors
AI cars are equipped with sensors to detect their surroundings, enabling them to make informed driving decisions.

### 💥 Collision Detection
Advanced collision detection systems ensure that both AI and user cars avoid crashes, adding to the challenge and realism.

### 🚗 Traffic Simulation
The road isn't empty! Navigate through dynamically simulated traffic, making the race even more competitive.

### 🤖 Neural Network
The AI car is powered by a custom neural network that has been meticulously trained for optimal performance.

### 🧠 Visualizing Neural Networks
Watch the AI's decision-making process in real-time with neural network visualization.

### 🛠️ Optimizing Neural Networks
Continuous optimization ensures that the AI car gets smarter and more competitive with each race.

## How to Use

1. **Race Against AI**: Control your car using the provided controls and try to beat the AI car.
2. **Training the AI**: The AI car's performance improves over time as it learns from its environment and races.
